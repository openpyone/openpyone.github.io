        <h2 class="text-topic">Can You Figure Out What Subject Miss Apple Teaches?</h2>
        <p>There are three students — Banana, Cherry, and Durian — talking to the new transfer student, Watermelon, about what subject Miss Apple teaches.</p>
        <p class="fw-bold">Banana: "Miss Apple teaches English."</p>
        <p class="fw-bold">Cherry: "Miss Apple doesn't teach Science."</p>
        <p class="fw-bold">Durian: "Miss Apple either teaches English or Math."</p>
        <p>After hearing all that, Watermelon is still confused. So he goes straight to ask the teacher.</p>
        <p>Watermelon: "Excuse me, Miss Apple, what subject do you actually teach?"</p>
        <p class="fw-bold">Miss Apple: "Some of what your classmates said is true, and some isn't. Think about it!"</p>

        <h2 class="text-topic">Question:</h2>
        <p>Based on what everyone said, what subject does Miss Apple really teach?</p>
